# Rules for Coding Style
1) Comment your code
2) Branches
- Make new branches for new features, bug fixes, and other code edits
- Delete branches when they've been merged successfully
- Make branches from issues to resolve them
3) Other Rules
- Branches, and HTML element class names and ids should be in <i>kebab-case</i> (Have words seperated by a hyphen)
- js files that represent a page in the app should be <i>PascalCase</i> (Each word starts with a capital letter, no spaces). All other files should be <i>snake_case</i> (Spaces are represented by the "_" character)
- Use tabs to indent lines
- Indent all children of an HTML element
- Use css for all styling
