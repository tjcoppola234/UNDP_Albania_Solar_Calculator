 ## Number of Panels Calculator

This calculator determines the number of panels you would need to install to cover your entire electricity needs.
 1) Select the municipality that your building is located in under **Select your municipality**. The municipality you select is used to determine the average amount of sunlight per month/year for your building.
 2) Scroll through the table under **Solar Panel Info** and click on **Use this panel** under **Panel Selection** if you find a solar panel model you are interested in using.
 
    OR
    
    - Click **Enter photovoltaics manually** and enter the following fields manually:
    - **Cost for one kW of panel**: In Euros, the price of a singular solar panel that you are looking to purchase.
    - **Area of one solar panel**: In meters-squared, the length times the width of a singular solar panel that you are looking to purchase.
    - **Peak capacity of one solar panel (W)**: In kilowatts (kW), the capacity of a singular solar panel that you are looking to purchase.
    
    OR
    
    - Click **Switch to using efficiency** and enter the efficiency (%) of a singular solar panel that you are looking to purchase under **Efficiency of solar panels** if you do not know the peak capacity.
 3) Under **Electricity usage per month**, enter, in kilowatt-hours (kWh), the amount of electricity your business uses on average per month. This information should be on your electricity bill, or can be easily calculated by taking the average of the last 12 months of electricity usage for your business. If instead you would like to enter your yearly electricity bill, click on the slider to swap between **months** and **years**.
 4) On the right hand panel, the number of panels you need for your system is under **Panels Required**.

 ## Payback Period Calculator

This calculator determines how long it will take to break even on your initial solar panel system purchase.
 1) If you haven’t already from the previous calculator, select the municipality that your building is located in under **Select your municipality**. The municipality you select is used to determine the average amount of sunlight per month/year for your building.
 2) Scroll through the table under **Example Solar Photovoltaics** and click on Use this panel under **Panel Selection** if you find a solar panel model you are interested in using.
 
    OR
    
    Click **Enter photovoltaics manually** and enter the following fields manually:
    - **Cost for one kW of panel**: In Euros, the price of a singular solar panel that you are looking to purchase.
    - **Area of one solar panel**: In meters-squared, the length times the width of a singular solar panel that you are looking to purchase.
    - **Peak capacity of one solar panel (W)**: In kilowatts (kW), the capacity of a singular solar panel that you are looking to purchase.
    
    OR
    
    - Click **Switch to using efficiency** and enter the efficiency (%) of a singular solar panel that you are looking to purchase under **Efficiency of solar panels** if you do not know the peak capacity.
 3) Under **Price of electricity** enter, in Lek/kWh, the most recent price of electricity per kilowatt hour for your business.
 4) Under **Flat roof space available for solar** enter, in meters-squared, the amount of flat, open space you have on your business' roof for solar photovoltaics. If you don't know the exact amount, provide a rough estimate. Keep in mind that the roof space must receive sunlight for solar photovoltaics to work there.
 5) Under **Percent of PV Share**, enter how much of your total energy usage you want to replace with solar photovoltaic generation. For example, if you enter “50”, then 50% of your current electricity usage will be generated by solar photovoltaics, and the other 50% will come from the grid.
 6) On the right hand panel, the energy system generated by the system, the total amount saved, the total cost, the payback period, and CO2 savings is shown.
